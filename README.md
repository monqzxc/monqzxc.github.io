# Mon — Anthony Cabigayan

A responsive portfolio with a dark Pokémon-inspired theme, Gengar purple and Gible blue accents, frosted glass surfaces, Manrope headings, DM Sans body text, custom artwork, project detail dialogs, a career timeline, and a Vue-powered interests section.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 22.18 or newer (Node.js 24 recommended). In this folder run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. For a production build:

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

A pnpm lockfile is also included if you prefer pnpm.

## How the frameworks fit together

- **Next.js** provides the App Router, page metadata, pre-rendering, and production build.
- **React** renders the portfolio and handles navigation, project dialogs, and the email form.
- **Vue 3** powers the interactive Beyond the Terminal section. It is loaded dynamically and mounts into a dedicated DOM node. React never renders inside that node, and the Vue app is unmounted when its React wrapper is removed.

The hosted preview uses the same application components with the Sites Vinext adapter. This download runs directly on Next.js and has been checked with a native Next.js production build.

## Where to edit

| Content | File |
| --- | --- |
| Hero introduction and artwork | `components/hero.tsx` |
| Contact and timeline | `components/portfolio.tsx` |
| Floating Pokéball menu and shared section links | `components/floating-menu.tsx`, `lib/navigation.ts` |
| Email modal and Formspree endpoint | `components/contact-modal.tsx` |
| Selected work titles, descriptions, and preview paths | `lib/projects.ts` |
| Project cards and interactive preview dialogs | `components/project-card.tsx` |
| Preview card and dialog styles | `app/project-previews.css` |
| Supplied HTML walkthroughs and shared embed styles | `public/project-previews/` |
| Base layout and responsive rules | `app/globals.css` |
| Glass surfaces, typography, and visual refinements | `app/glass-theme.css` |
| Illustrated hero layout and responsive rules | `app/hero.css` |
| Final purple/blue palette, panels, buttons, and character labels | `app/pokemon-theme.css` |
| Self-hosted fonts and their OFL licenses | `public/fonts/` |
| Vue interests and tab behavior | `components/craft-app.ts` |
| React/Vue lifecycle boundary | `components/vue-craft.tsx` |
| Page title and description | `app/layout.tsx` |
| MON, Gengar, and Gible hero artwork | `public/images/mon-pokemon-hero.png` |
| Exact artwork prompt and desktop preview | `docs/hero-art-prompt.txt`, `docs/hero-preview.jpg` |
| Favicon | `public/favicon.svg` |

Selected work includes Application Exam Management, HRIS Process, Job Application, PCR Management, PDS Generation, and ARTA Client Survey. Each card shows its supplied HTML walkthrough and opens an interactive preview with working step navigation. A separate link opens the complete walkthrough in a new tab. The previews use simplified screens and sample data. The email and GitHub links come from your supplied HTML; placeholder social-profile links were omitted.

The walkthroughs are bundled under `public/project-previews/` so GitHub Pages exports include their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Original source folders remain separate. The shared `embed.js` and `embed.css` adapt the same HTML for thumbnails and dialogs; opening a page without a preview parameter shows the full original introduction. Walkthrough fonts request Google Fonts with local system fallbacks.

The hero follows the supplied reference's composition, pairing bold name typography with an isometric MON sculpture above Gengar and Gible. Its transparent PNG was created with the built-in image generation tool and is included at 1254 × 1254 pixels. The exact prompt is included in `docs/hero-art-prompt.txt`.

The hero keeps the professional name, role, and work link prominent, with the personality line “Serious about systems. Soft spot for Pokémon.” The purple and blue theme continues through navigation, project previews, badges, the career timeline, interest tabs, and the contact panel. `app/pokemon-theme.css` loads after the base glass and hero styles.

## Scroll reveal

Sections, project cards, and timeline entries fade in and rise as they enter the viewport, once per page load. Nearby entries stagger by 75ms, capped at 225ms. The effect respects reduced-motion settings, shows keyboard-focused content immediately, and keeps content readable when JavaScript is unavailable.

Edit `hooks/use-scroll-reveal.ts` to change the targets and trigger, and `app/scroll-reveal.css` to change timing or travel distance.

## Included behavior

The interests section includes traveling, running, watching anime, infrastructure, Python and automation, and collaboration. Edit the entries in `components/craft-app.ts` to personalize the descriptions.

Manrope and DM Sans are bundled as variable WOFF2 fonts and preloaded by the page layout. Font files are served locally; the page does not depend on an external font service. Glass panels use translucent gradients, soft borders, and backdrop blur, with a solid-background fallback where blur is unsupported.

Responsive navigation; project dialogs with focus handling and Escape support; Vue tabs with arrow, Home, and End key navigation; reduced-motion support; and skip navigation. A floating Pokéball with the theme's contrasting accent color opens circular shortcuts for the page destinations, the games hub, and a single **Let’s talk** action. It closes on Escape, outside clicks, or leaving the menu with the keyboard.

**Let’s talk** in either navigation menu and the email icons beside GitHub open the same modal with required email and message fields. Drafts stay available when switching between these entry points. The form posts to `https://formspree.io/f/xvkgbwbr`, shows sending/success/error feedback, and keeps the draft after a failed request. Formspree handles delivery to the recipient configured for that form, so the GitHub Pages site needs no server. Visitors can also open their email app using the direct email link.

The Vue build flags are configured in `next.config.ts`. The scripts use Webpack so the same explicit flags are applied in development and production.

## Verification

- Native Next.js 16 production compilation, TypeScript, and page prerendering passed.
- Hosted application TypeScript check passed.
- Desktop layout, project dialogs, Vue tab clicks and keyboard navigation were checked in a browser.
- A 390px mobile frame (375px content width with a scrollbar) had no horizontal overflow. Its menu and scrolling project dialog were checked.

## CV Studio

Open `/cv` for a client-only CV editor with an A4 preview and PDF export. Visitors can edit Mon's example or choose **Start my CV** for a blank form. Add or remove employment, education, training, and recognition entries. Blank sections are omitted, longer entries flow to additional pages, and unsupported font characters produce a clear message rather than disappearing.

The editor does not send CV input to a server or save it to browser storage. A draft stays in the current tab until refresh or navigation; export before leaving. The download is a selectable-text PDF with embedded, locally served DM Sans fonts.

- `lib/cv-data.ts`: Anthony's confirmed employment, freelance period, education, eligibility, training, and awards.
- `lib/cv-pdf.ts`: shared layout for the SVG preview and PDF, including wrapping and pagination.
- `components/cv/cv-builder.tsx`: visitor form, validation, section tabs, and download actions.
- `app/cv/cv.css`: CV Studio's responsive dark glass interface.
- `public/cv/Anthony-Cabigayan-CV.pdf`: finished one-page CV linked from the hero and editor.

After changing Mon's data, regenerate his static download with `npm run generate:cv` before building. This uses the same PDF renderer as visitor exports. No API key, account, database, or third-party document service is needed. Site sharing controls determine who can access the hosted builder.

## Laser Grid Lock

Play `/play/laser-grid-lock/` to guide Deoxys through five tiers of laser puzzles: mirrors, fixed steel terrain, patrolling deflectors, splitting monsters, Beam Eaters, multi-angle prism targets, and ordered nodes. Master portals move every two player shifts. Clear each level to advance and unlock the next tier; Undo restores the full previous turn. Progress saves locally after each win, and refreshing restarts the current unlocked level.

See [the game rules and tier progression](docs/laser-grid-lock.md). Run `npm run test:laser` for terrain, monsters, EMP, branch tracing, targets, and generated-level solution checks.

Solrock redirects light, Lunatone absorbs it, and Minior splits it. Clear levels 1–14 to reach Rayquaza. From level 15, its Delta Stream seals the portal and locks a rotating row for three phases before a one-turn opening.

## Games hub

Open `/play/`, or follow **Games** from the homepage, to find every game together. The homepage's grouped games section and the hub both use the shared catalog in `lib/games.ts`.

Keep future games in this collection:

1. Create the game route at `app/play/<slug>/page.tsx`.
2. Add its name, description, player count, category, and artwork to `lib/games.ts`. The entry automatically appears in the homepage collection and games hub.
3. Include an **All games** link back to `/play/` on the game page. Keep homepage game promotion in the shared collection instead of adding a separate banner for each game.

## Pokémon tile puzzle

Open `/play/puzzle/`, or choose **Pokémon Tile Puzzle** from the games collection. Choose Gengar, Charizard, Pikachu, Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, Bidoof, Mew, or Mewtwo and a 3×3 or 4×4 board. Every shuffle comes from legal moves, so it is solvable. Click or tap an adjacent tile, or focus the board and use arrow keys to move a tile in that direction. Numbers and the reference picture can be toggled while playing.

The timer starts when playing, pauses on request or when the tab becomes hidden, and resumes without counting time away. The current board, move count, elapsed time, and latest 50 wins use the versioned `mon-tile-puzzle-v1` localStorage key. Records are separated by Pokémon and board size, with best time and fewest moves calculated from the saved wins. Refreshing restores the current board paused; a completed game does not record a duplicate win. Malformed saved data is validated before use, and blocked storage leaves the game playable with an explanatory message. Scores are local to the browser and origin; clearing browser data removes them.

- `components/tile-puzzle.tsx`: game controls, timing, persistence, and scores.
- `lib/tile-puzzle.ts`: board rules, solvable shuffles, and saved-data validation.
- `lib/puzzle-pokemon.ts`: image choices, colors, and time formatting.
- `app/play/puzzle.css`: responsive game layout and tile animation.
- `public/images/puzzle/`: bundled artwork and source attribution.

Run `npm run test:puzzle` for the puzzle logic and saved-data checks, and `npm run typecheck` for TypeScript. The game and artwork are included in the regular static export and need no API or game server.

## Poké Raft

Open `/play/raft/`, or choose **Poké Raft** from the games collection, for a turn-based artillery game. Play against Easy or Hard AI, take turns on the same device, or choose online play to create or join a room from separate devices. Pick Pikachu, Gengar, Charizard, or Bidoof; all four have equal stats.

Adjust the angle and power, account for the wind, and fire toward the rival raft. Wind changes after both players have taken a turn, and nearby impacts can cause splash damage. Pikachu uses Electro Ball, Gengar uses Shadow Ball, Charizard uses Flame Thrower, and Bidoof uses Rock Throw. Each player starts with 100 HP, unlimited standard attacks, and three stronger charged attacks. Reduce the rival's HP to zero to win. Easy AI allows more aiming error; Hard AI calculates shots using the current wind.

All four characters breathe, step in place at the start of a turn, wind up and attack, taunt, and recoil when hit. The **Taunt** button works during your turn and has a five-second cooldown. Bidoof uses a generated twenty-frame sprite sheet; the other three animate their existing transparent artwork. Each attack has its own canvas effect. Reduced-motion settings use still poses and keep essential projectile movement. See [sprite assets and generation prompts](public/images/raft/README.md).

The game uses mouse, touch, and keyboard controls, existing Pokémon artwork, local fonts, and the dark purple visual theme. Each turn allows two minutes to fire; an expired turn is skipped. Local match state resets on refresh. Online rooms use PeerJS for a direct browser-to-browser connection, with the room host owning match state and a short reconnect window. No WebSocket backend or environment variable is required.

See [online multiplayer setup](docs/raft-multiplayer.md) for the PeerJS flow and local checks. Keep the host tab open while a match is in progress; closing it ends that room.

- `app/play/raft/page.tsx`: route and page metadata.
- `components/raft-battle.tsx`: setup, controls, turn handoffs, and match state.
- `components/raft-arena.tsx`: canvas arena, artwork, and shot animation.
- `lib/raft-battle.ts`: projectile physics, damage, turns, and AI difficulty.
- `lib/raft-online.ts`: shared room messages and online timing constants.
- `hooks/use-raft-online.ts`: PeerJS room transport and host-authoritative online state.
- `app/play/raft/raft.css`: responsive layout and game styling.
- `scripts/check-raft-battle.mjs`: physics, battle rules, and AI checks.

Run `npm run test:raft` for the game logic checks and `npm run typecheck` for TypeScript. Artwork sources remain documented in `public/images/puzzle/README.md`.
